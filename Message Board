Greetings, I made a text file.

Oliver:
Given the time constraints, I think we should focus on the most bare form of the gameplay loop possible. 
Shall we aim for a player with a single attack, a boss with 1-2 basic attacks, and a healing mechanic
For healing mechanic, the simple form I have in mind is simply a circle aura that players can turn on or off
